  # @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{y} =} filtfilt (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{x})
  #
  # Forward and reverse filter the signal. This corrects for phase
  # distortion introduced by a one-pass filter, though it does square the
  # magnitude response in the process. That's the theory at least.  In
  # practice the phase correction is not perfect, and magnitude response
  # is distorted, particularly in the stop band.
  #
  # Example
  # @example
  # @group
  # [b, a]=butter(3, 0.1);                  # 5 Hz low-pass filter
  # t = 0:0.01:1.0;                         # 1 second sample
  # x=sin(2*pi*t*2.3)+0.25*randn(size(t));  # 2.3 Hz sinusoid+noise
  # y = filtfilt(b,a,x); z = filter(b,a,x); # apply filter
  # plot(t,x,';data;',t,y,';filtfilt;',t,z,';filter;')
